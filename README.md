  Nubank redesign writen in React Native
</h1>

This design was made by Diego David (https://www.behance.net/gallery/98848371/NuBank-App-Redesign). I decided to implement using react native, applying the new way of making animations with react-native-reanimated.

Only available in Portuguese (BR)

Project made with Expo

### Main libraries

- mobx@6 (state management)
- react-native-magnus (ui components)
